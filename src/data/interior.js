    "The competition was organized by the Marshal's Office of the Lodz Region and the Lodz University of Technology to select the best exhibition design. <u>The conceptual design prepared by us won first place, thus being transferred to the implementation stage. After the competition, in close cooperation with the Office, we specified the design for the executive tender.</u>",
    "The main inspiration for the project was the golden autumn among the fields, referring to the time of the exhibition, distorted by the reversed direction of gravity.The centre of the composition was an immersive zone with a rectangular shape of four LED screens, on which shots from the Voivodeship were be displayed.",
    "Around it, the space was divided into two parts - traditional, related to culture and folklore, and modern, representing the enterprises of the region.",
